          Simplified Cement Mill Plant With PID Control
        </h1>
        <p class="text-muted w-75 mx-auto">
          The project has covered the material feeding process, the grinding
          process and the storage process. In the material feeding process, the
          operator has the ability to select which type of cement to grind. PID
          controllers have been used to maintain the feed rate at a specified
          setpoint for each raw material required. The feed rate depends on the
          type of cement selected. Watch the video below to see the functioning
          of this project. the code and SCADA is explained in details as you
          scroll down this page.

              start and stop the system, and you can also select the operation
              mode, either manual or automatic mode. In this page, raw materials
              comming from material feeding page are fed into the grinding mill.
              The grinded materials from the mill are the sucked by the 1800kw
              fan through the bag filter. The fine materials are then stored in
              the silo, while the course materials are taken back into the mill
              for more grinding.

              This snippet shows the Material Feeding page. All the raw material
              needed for cement production are measured in this page, the raw
              materials are: Clinker, Gypsum, Limestone and Pozzolana. In this
              page the operator can set the mill grinding rate, i.e 310 tph. The
              operator can also select the type of cement needed as the end
              product, and the raw materials setpoints will be populated with
              values depending on the cement type selected. For this plant, we
              have 4 diffrent types of cement that can be selected (In the
              snippet above KP_Silver is selected). A PID controller is used to
              maintain the actual feed rate of each raw material near the
              desired setpoint, as shown in the snippet above.

              This snippet shows the PID behaviour for each raw material belt.
              The black line is the setpoint, the green line is the actual feed
              rate of the raw materials, and the red line is the speed of the
              motor. The green light(actual feed rate) tries to get to the black
              line(the setpoint) and remain at that point. The motor speed at
              first ramps up in order to get the actual feed rate to the
              setpoint, and then reduces to a value where it can maintain the
              actual feed at the setpoint.

                This is a cyclic interrupt that runs every 0.5ms. The purpose of
                this block is to check the tye of cement selected at any time
                and compute the setpoints for each raw material neede. This
                happens every 0.5ms to ensure it detects any change in selection
                immediately . View the pdf file by clicking the link above

                This is a cyclic interrupt that runs every 1ms. It calls the
                function with the name (LoadCell_Simulation(FC) [FC2]). The
                purpose is to compute the loadcell reading every 1ms, This helps
                us in simulating the PID by giving us consistent loadcell
                reading. View the pdf file by clicking the link above

                This Block is a cyclic interrupt block, that runs every 1ms. The
                Block calls all the PID compact Blocks. This is the block where
                tuning and configuration of PIDS are done. Calculated Setpoints
                and loadcell readings are fed into the PID blocks. View the pdf

                This function handles the loadcell reading simulation
                process.The function is called by(LoadCell_Simulation(0.1s)
                [OB31]). For us to impliment the PID without a real world plc we
                needed to simulate the loadcell reading, and this function helps
                us do that. The function also limits the loadcell reading to 350
                as the maximum and zero as the minimum. View the pdf file by

                This function handles the cement type selection process.The
                function is called by(Cement_TypesSelection [OB33]). When a
                cement type is selected by the operator, this is the function
                that handles the selection. It uses an SR Flip-flop to set the
                selection, and the flip-flop is reset if another cement type is
                selected.View the pdf file by clicking the link above.

                type is selected. According to the type of cement selected, the
                setpoints for that cement are moved from the MaterialRationing
